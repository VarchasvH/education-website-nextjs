In this project, I've had the pleasure of building a demo Education website using Next.js and Tailwind CSS. As a passionate learner in the realm of web development, particularly in the domains of Docker, Kubernetes, and Linux, I wanted to create a platform that serves as both a learning resource and a showcase of my skills.

## Technologies Used
- NextJS
- Tailwind CSS
- Aceternity UI
