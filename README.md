[screen-capture.webm](https://github.com/VarchasvH/education-website-nextjs/assets/100064742/475456e5-4cf4-49c8-8db0-aac08ba9146a)


In this project, I've had the pleasure of building a demo Education website using Next.js and Tailwind CSS. As a passionate learner in the realm of web development, particularly in the domains of Docker, Kubernetes, and Linux, I wanted to create a platform that serves as both a learning resource and a showcase of my skills.

## Technologies Used
- NextJS
- Tailwind CSS
- Aceternity UI
